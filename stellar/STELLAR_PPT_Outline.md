# STELLAR-v1k PowerPoint Presentation Outline
## Suggested Slide Structure (10-12 Slides)

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**STELLAR-v1k**  
AI-Powered GNSS Error Forecasting & Early Warning System

- Team: Divik Arora | Harsh Dixit | Ansh Kaushik
- Mentor: Ms. Vimmi Malhotra
- Institution: Dronacharya College of Engineering
- Date: December 2025

*Background: Space/satellite imagery*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Critical Infrastructure at Risk**

[Visual: World map with satellite coverage]

- GNSS powers: Aviation, Finance, Power Grids, Autonomous Vehicles
- Satellite errors = Positioning errors of several meters
- Current systems are REACTIVE
- Errors detected AFTER damage is done

*Key stat: "$70+ billion industry at risk from navigation failures"*

---

## Slide 3: Our Solution
**STELLAR-v1k: Predict Before Impact**

[Visual: Dashboard screenshot]

- AI-powered PROACTIVE forecasting
- Predict errors 15 min to 24 hours ahead
- Multi-constellation: GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BeiDou, NavIC
- Browser-native ML (no servers needed)

*Tagline: "Peer into the depths of satellite navigation"*

---

## Slide 4: How It Works
**Technical Architecture**

[Visual: Architecture diagram]

1. Ingest satellite telemetry data
2. Process through LSTM-Attention neural network
3. Generate multi-horizon forecasts
4. Detect anomalies in real-time
5. Alert operators before impact

## Slide 5: AI/ML Models
**The Brain of STELLAR**

[Visual: Neural network diagram]

**STELLAR-Forecast-v1k**
- LSTM-Attention Hybrid
- 672 input points → 8 forecast horizons
- TensorFlow.js (runs in browser!)

**STELLAR-AnomalyDetector**
- Autoencoder architecture
- Real-time anomaly scoring
- Severity: NORMAL → WARNING → CRITICAL
